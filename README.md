## **Project Overview**

This project performs customer segmentation analysis to discover meaningful groups based on purchasing and demographic patterns. Such segmentation helps businesses deliver targeted marketing strategies, understand customer behavior, and optimize conversions.

**Techniques & Workflow**

* Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for modeling.

* Feature Engineering: Created meaningful variables that influence clustering.

* Clustering Techniques: Applied methods such as K-Means and possibly RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers.

* Visualization: Used plots to reveal cluster characteristics and insights.

**Methodology Summary**

* Load the Data – Import and clean the dataset.

* Preprocess & Feature Engineering – Handle missing values, encoding, normalization.

* Modeling – Apply K-Means or RFM + clustering algorithms to identify customer segments.

* Evaluation & Visualization – Use the Elbow method and silhouette scores, visualize clusters with scatter plots or histograms.

* Interpret Insights – Characterize segments and suggest strategies tailored to each group.

**Results**

* Identified distinct customer groups (“High-Value”, “Occasional”, “At-Risk”) based on spending patterns and frequency metrics.

* Visualizations clarify how segments differ in terms of income, engagement, or spending behavior.

* Insights can be leveraged for marketing: targeted campaigns, loyalty offers, or customer retention strategies.
